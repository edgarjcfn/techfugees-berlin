# Techfugees Meetup #1

## Introduction
This is a small writeup of what happened during the first meetup

## Presentations
1. Edgar and Tadas presented the intro slides and talked brifly about the apps developed by memorado. Slides can be found at the `meetup1` folder.
2. Jan Lindenberg presented his project Infocompass. The project aggregates information helpful to refugees and displays them on a map. It's developed as a responsive web-application. Some of the most relevant information is also provided in print, at a location called InfoPoint in Reinickendorf
3. Two participants of the hackathon that took place on the week before presented 2 projects: [Interpreteer](http://www.interpreteer.de/) a translation offer-and-request system, and a project codenamed "Project Brain" - a matrix of commonly-faced problems by people who design tech solutions for refugees, and a design of how central solutions could be developed for such problems.

## Discussions and main take-aways
1. There are several clusters of similar projects going on right now. People work on similar apps without knowing what has already been developed. There seems to be a need to make projects discoverable with updated information as to current status / how to use / how to colaborate.
2. Channels / groups that we should reach out to, and collaborate
  - [Slack channel](https://de-refugees-slackin.herokuapp.com)
  - [OK Lab](http://www.meetup.com/OK-Lab-Berlin/) will host continuation of hackathon projects
  - [Migration Hub](http://refugeehackathon.de/en/2015/09/20/migrationhub/) A co-working space dedicated to projects focused on refugees
