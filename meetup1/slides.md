#Why are we here?
 Our company promoted a hack event

 1 week = 4 apps, published

 All apps to help refugees

 Read all about it [here](https://medium.com/@Memorado/)

 Now, we got hooked!

 We want to know who else out there has done similar apps

 (Collaborate, work together, ship and update more relevant apps!)
